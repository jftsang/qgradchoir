<p>Queens' Graduate Choir is a relaxed, non-auditioned choir consisting mostly
of graduate students and alumni of <a
href="http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/">Queens' College Cambridge</a> (although we
welcome others!). Around 20-strong, the choir performs a wide variety of music
from sacred motets to pop classics.</p>

<p>We perform at various college events in Queens' throughout the year,
including the MCR Christmas dinners, Choral Evensongs, summer garden party, and
termly concerts.</p>

<p>The Graduate Choir membership represents a broad range of ages, subjects and
levels of singing experience. Emphasis in rehearsal is placed on improving as
singers, exploring a broad range of choral repertoire, and most importantly
having fun! There are no auditions &mdash; the only requirement is a desire to
sing!</p>

<h3>Rehearsals</h3>

<p>We rehearse in <a
href="http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/chapel-and-spiritual-life-in-queens">Queens'
College Chapel</a> 6:30pm to 7:30pm every Thursday during term, and usually
outside term as well. We are always happy to welcome new members, so don't
worry about coming along for the first time. Bring a friend!</p>
